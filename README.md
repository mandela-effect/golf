## Rules
Cards are worth their face value. Jacks and 2s are worth 0, Aces are worth 11, and pairs cancel out.

On your turn you can: lock in a card from the deck, the discard pile, or flip one of your cards straight-up. To reject a picked card discard it first, then pick one of your face down cards to flip.
